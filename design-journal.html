        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I've been planning to get more into web and ui/ux design, so I hope to learn as much as I can about the langauges and softwares we're going to use. I've always been afraid of coding/programming and I want to face my fears and even learn to enjoy it. I also hope to create at least one project that will enhance my portfolio. Animation is another topic I really like and I hope to learn how to use animations on websites.</p>
        <p>A website I've always liked is <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/">Tablet Magazine's Website, done by Pentagram</a>. It's clean but still evokes B&W newspapers, which I love!</p>
