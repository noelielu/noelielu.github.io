        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I've been planning to get more into web and ui/ux design, so I hope to learn as much as I can about the langauges and softwares we're going to use. I've always been afraid of coding/programming and I want to face my fears and even learn to enjoy it. I also hope to create at least one project that will enhance my portfolio. Animation is another topic I really like and I hope to learn how to use animations on websites.</p>
        <p>A website I've always liked is <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/">Tablet Magazine's Website, done by Pentagram</a>. It's clean but still evokes B&W newspapers, which I love!</p>

        <p>Love how this website looks like a sketchbook page.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I am planning a food diary website, that has pictures and illustrations of food I ate last week. I plan to have a framework that keeps the pages consistent, while I move the images around and add doodles to make the pages different. My color platte will be either B&W or a color assigned to each dish. My imagery will be very hands-on (shot on iphone) and edited to look like a collage. These will all complement the diary/sketchbook concept.</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: So clean and minimal, but effective with the animations! <a href="http://www.stk.works" target="_blank"><img src="images/week2inspo.png" alt="oops" class="inspo-img"/>
